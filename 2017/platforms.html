		<p> Students explored a number of new and emerging platforms to publish their projects. The following are the platforms they used for their final projects.</p>
		<p><b>Digital platforms</b></p>
		<p><a href="https://issuu.com/">ISSUU</a> is a free platform which supports online viewing and downloading for interactive PDFs. It is used internationally and works across various devices.</p>
		<p><a href="https://archive.org/index.php">The Internet Archive</a> is the largest archive of public domain resources online. The students used it to both source materials for their publications and to publish their works on there making them available for free viewing and downloading under a CC0 license.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en">Instagram</a> is a popular social media platform for image sharing. Students used it both as a research aid, as well as a platform to publish their research.</p>
		<p><a href="https://newhive.com/b/">NewHive</a> is an emerging online platform popular among artists and designers. It enables its users to create online pages (or "hives") from scratch with the possibility to custimize all aspects of the page's content and design layout. Hives are easy to share within the NewHive community and beyond.</p>
		<p><b>Print-on-demand platforms</b></p>
		<p><a href="http://www.blurb.co.uk/">Blurb</a> is a popular print-on-demand platform, facilitated by the flexibility of digital printing technologies. Blurb enables its users to upload PDF or ePub files and distribute these as one-off printed publications. The production process is based on a model of shared profit and is free of cost to the publisher. Blurb is available within a few countries only.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.lulu.com/">Lulu</a> provides a similar service to Blurb with some variations in the options to customise the printed edition. Unlike Blurb, it is available in over 200 countries worldwide.</p>
