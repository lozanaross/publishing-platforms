		<p> Students explored a number of online platforms throughout the duration of this module. The following are the platforms they used for their final projects.</p>
		<br>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Digital platforms</span></p>
		<p><a href="https://archive.org/index.php">The Internet Archive</a> is the largest archive of public domain resources online. The students used it to both source materials for their publications and to publish their works on there, making them available for free viewing and downloading in a variety of formats such as epub and torrent files, under a CC0 license.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a> is a popular social media platform for image sharing. Students used it both as a research aid, as well as a platform to publish their research.</p>
		<br>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Print-on-demand platforms</span></p>
		<p><a href="http://www.blurb.co.uk/">Blurb</a> is a popular print-on-demand platform, facilitated by the flexibility of digital printing technologies. Blurb enables its users to upload PDF or ePub files and distribute these as one-off printed publications. The production process is based on a model of shared profit and is free of cost to the publisher. Blurb is available within a few countries only.</p>
