		<p> Students explored a number of online platforms throughout the duration of this module. The following are the platforms they used for their final projects.</p>
		<br>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Digital platforms</span></p>
		<p><a href="https://archive.org/index.php">The Internet Archive</a> is the largest archive of public domain resources online. Students used it both to source materials and to publish their own projects â€“ making them available for free viewing and downloading as interactive EPUBs or PDFs.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> is a widely used social media platform for video sharing. Students used it to publish screencasts of their interactive digital editions or print-on-demand outputs.</p><br>

		<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a> is a popular social media platform for image sharing. Students used it both as a research aid, as well as a platform to publish their research.</p><br>

		<p><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> is an image-led microblogging platform that has been widely used by artists and visual creatives since its launch in 2007. Students used it both as a research aid, as well as a platform to publish their research.</p><br>

		<p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a platform primarily used by developers to share open source code for applications, but it is increasingly used in the cultural heritage domain for open data and file sharing, too. Students used it to publish source files and final outputs for their interactive publications.</p><br>

		<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Commons</a> is a large public platform hosting millions of images licensed under Creative Commons. Students used it as a research resource.</p><br>

		<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Print-on-demand platforms</span></p>
		<p><a href="http://www.blurb.co.uk/">Blurb</a> is a popular print-on-demand platform. Blurb enables its users to upload pdf or epub files and distribute these as one-off printed publications. The production process is based on a model of shared profit and is free of cost to the publisher. Blurb is available within a few countries only.</p><br>

		<p><a href="https://www.lulu.com/">Lulu</a> provides a similar service to Blurb with some variations in the options to customise the printed edition. Unlike Blurb, it is available in over 200 countries worldwide.</p>
