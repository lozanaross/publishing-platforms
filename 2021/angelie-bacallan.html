		<h1>Angelie Bacallan</h1>
		<p>Music has the ability to alter our emotions, offer an escape from reality and makes the listening experience emerging and dynamic. Mood-motivated and theme-based listening is at odds with music traditionally organised by genre, artist or album. This publishing project showcases a small selection of these mood and thematic playlists created by Spotify and its users. The print-on-demand book can be purchased and previewed on <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.lulu.com/en/gb/shop/angelie-bacallan/oh-so-you-love-making-playlists-one-for-every-mood/paperback/product-7zqgjm.html?page=1&pageSize=4">Lulu</a>; the EPUB version of the book can be previewed and downloaded for free via the <a href="https://href.li/?https://archive.org/details/ohplaylistsforeverymood_digital_202105">Internet Archive</a>; playlists and song previews can also be browsed on <a href="https://ohplaylistsforeverymood.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>.

		The Spotify Codes in the publication were sourced directly from the Spotify app. To access these playlists and listen to the songs: open the Spotify app on your phone > press ‘Search’ in the navigation bar > tap the camera icon > point your camera at the Spotify Code over a code within the book.</p>
