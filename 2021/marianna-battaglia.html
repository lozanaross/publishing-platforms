		<h1>Marianna Battaglia</h1>
		<p>The book AITA is a curated ollection of posts published by Reddit users on the 'AITA - Am I the Asshole?' sub-channel. Crossing themes such as racism, sexism and pastry, each story will question the reader's morals, involving them in an iconographic journey populated by photographs of everyday life, memes and figures taken from the world of open web sources. By cataloguing and preserving the fluid and elusive material of social media platforms, AITA offers a reflection on the blurry relationship between author and reader in the digital age. The printed book can be purchased and previewed on <a href="https://www.blurb.com/b/10730471-aita-am-i-the-asshole">Blurb</a>. The e-book can be previewed and downloaded for free via the <a href="https://archive.org/details/AITA_Battaglia/page/n37/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>. You can also experience an <a href="https://instagram.com/aita_thebook" target="_blank">Instagram</a> version of the book.
