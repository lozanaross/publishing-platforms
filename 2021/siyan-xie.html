		<h1>Siyan Xie</h1>
		<p>This project proposes that further exploration of the long-term survival of cultural heritage and sustainable utilization of cave murals can be motivated via hybrid publishing work. The book is divided into four parts: Dunhuang Caves and Kizil Caves in China, as well as collections in the Guimet Museum and the British Museum, which are the two most representative museums for the collection of these murals and textiles overseas. All the information collected in this book comes from public online resources, Dunhuang Research Institute or the British Museum. The copyright belongs to the original copyright holders. The EPUB version of the book can be downloaded for free via the <a href="https://archive.org/details/dunhuang-epub">Internet Archive</a>. A print-on-demand edition of the book can be purchased from <a href="https://www.lulu.com/en/en/shop/pony-xie/endless-stories/hardcover/product-kgw5d6.html?page=1&pageSize=4">Lulu</a>.</p>
