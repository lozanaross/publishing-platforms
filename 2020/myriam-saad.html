		<h1>Myriam Saad</h1>
		<p>"Beirut - Reclaiming a Nation" narrates a visual story of Beirut in its golden days through a rich archive of immersive images that tell the story of the city. The images are from the 40s, 50s, 60s, and beginning of the 70s, before the civil war. The book is also an attempt to honor all the efforts currently being put forward by the Lebanese youth to reclaim a nation that has long been stolen from them. The epub version of the book can be downloaded from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/singlepages-withedits-new-buttons_20200602">Internet Archive</a>, and a print-on-demand book is also available on <a href="https://www.blurb.com/books/10144271-beirut">Blurb</a>. A preview of the interactive book can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YyOSMnAe3Is">Youtube</a>.</p>
