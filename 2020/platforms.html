		<p> Students explored a number of online platforms throughout the duration of this module. The following are the platforms they used for their final projects.</p>
		<br>
		<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Digital platforms</span></p>
		<p><a href="https://archive.org/index.php">The Internet Archive</a> is the largest archive of public domain resources online. Students used it both to source materials and to publish their own projects â€“ making them available for free viewing and downloading as interactive EPUBs or PDFs.</p>

		<p><a href="https://issuu.com/">ISSUU</a> is a free (ad-supported) platform which supports online viewing and downloading of interactive PDFs.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> is a widely used social media platform for video sharing. Students used it both as a source for relevant video material and as a publishing channel to share screencasts of their interactive digital editions.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is a widely used social media platform. Students used it to source material for some of their projects and worked with its native features (retweets, replies, and threads) to develop supplementary narratives to their main publishing channels.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na</a> is an independent alternative to mainstream social media platforms, popular among artists, designers and researchers. Students used it both for research and as a publishing platform, utilising its native features to structure materials as visual "blocks" sorted into "channels".</p>
		<br>

		<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">Print-on-demand platforms</span></p>
		<p><a href="http://www.blurb.co.uk/">Blurb</a> is a popular print-on-demand platform. Blurb enables its users to upload pdf or epub files and distribute these as one-off printed publications. The production process is based on a model of shared profit and is free of cost to the publisher. Blurb is available within a few countries only.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.lulu.com/">Lulu</a> provides a similar service to Blurb with some variations in the options to customise the printed edition. Unlike Blurb, it is available in over 200 countries worldwide.</p>
