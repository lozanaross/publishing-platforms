		<h1>Ella MacKinnon</h1>
		<p>One hundred years on since (some) women were first able to vote in the UK, this project attempts to highlight the events that took place, both inside and outside the Houses of Parliament, in the lead up to this historic milestone in the history of womenâ€™s equality in Britain. The project consists of a print-on-demand book, which is available through <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/ella-mackinnon/the-fight-for-womens-rights-1918-2018/paperback/product-23637483.html">Lulu</a>, and a digital publication which is hosted in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheFightForWomensRights1918-2018">Internet Archive</a>.</p>
